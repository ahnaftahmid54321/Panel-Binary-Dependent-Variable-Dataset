Analyzing Both Panel dataset and Binary Dependent Variable Dataset


Description of Panel Dataset 

The dataset shows US panel data from 1983-1997. Using USSeatBelts, we are trying to answer how the number of fatalities per million of traffic miles (fatalities) is affected by seatbelt usage rate (seatbelt), whether there is a 65 mile per hour speed limit (speed65), whether there is a maximum of 0.08 blood alcohol content (alcohol), the median per capita income (income), and mean age (age). USSeatBelts can be found in the AER library: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AER/AER.pdf
